# counting_words
This module is supposed to count words in a string without exception. By exception, we mean every string irrespective of how it looks like.

### `count_words.py`
This is the main module that counts words

### `test_count_words.py`
This is the file that tests the `count_words.py`

Since we want to conform to PEP8 convection, we are going to use a linter to render our code.

In this case we are going to use `pylint`

We created a virtual env for this module using: `virtualenv -p python3.8 word_counting_env`

This ensures that there is no pre-installed python modules. It is just empty.

To activate this environment:
`source word_counting_env/bin/activate`

### NOTE:
Always start with a failing test to make sure that your tests are being read!
